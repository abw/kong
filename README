This is a playground project for experimenting with the Raphaël Javascript
library which provides a wrapper around the HTML canvas object.  See
http://raphaeljs.com/ for further details.

It is a re-implementation of the classic gorilla.bas game. See here for more
info: http://blog.yapb.net/post/2009/12/29/How-I-became-a-programmer.aspx
Back in the early 90's I wrote my own version of the game (or rather, adapted
the original source code).  So this is an opportunity for a bit of nostalgia 
while getting to grips with Raphaël.
